    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rasgulla is a popular Indian dessert known for its soft, spongy texture and gentle sweetness. This treat hails primarily from the eastern states of India, particularly West Bengal and Odisha. It is crafted from chhena, a type of fresh cheese, which is shaped into small balls and simmered in a light sugar syrup. This process allows the rasgulla to soak up the syrup, resulting in a moist and flavorful delicacy. Often enjoyed during festivals and special events, rasgulla not only satisfies the sweet tooth but also reflects the rich traditions of Indian sweets. Its melt-in-your-mouth quality and mild sweetness have made it a favorite not just in India, but around the world.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cardamom pods</li>
        <li>Rose water</li>
        <li>Ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the milk in a heavy pan, then gradually add lemon juice or vinegar while stirring until the milk curdles and separates into curds and whey.</li>
        <li>Strain the curds using a muslin cloth, rinsing with cold water to remove any sourness, and squeeze out the excess water to ensure the chhena is not too wet.</li>
        <li>Knead the chhena for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and pliable, which is essential for forming the balls.</li>
        <li>Divide the kneaded chhena into small portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, mix sugar and water to create a syrup, then bring it to a boil until the sugar completely dissolves.</li>
        <li>Gently add the chhena balls to the boiling syrup and cover, cooking for 15-20 minutes. The balls will expand and become spongy.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, allow the rasgullas to cool in the syrup, which helps them absorb the sweetness before serving.</li>
    </ol>
