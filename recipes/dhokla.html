    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dhokla is a highly regarded snack originating from Gujarat, India, celebrated for its light, airy texture and savory profile. This dish is primarily made from fermented chickpea flour and is steamed to achieve a soft, spongy consistency, often enhanced with seasonings such as turmeric, ginger, and green chilies. Typically cut into square or diamond shapes, dhokla is garnished with mustard seeds and fresh coriander, and is frequently accompanied by green or sweet tamarind chutney, making it both a flavorful and nutritious option for snacking or breakfast.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine chickpea flour, yogurt, turmeric powder, chopped green chilies, grated ginger, and salt. Gradually add water to achieve a smooth, pourable batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Ferment (Optional):</strong> If using yogurt, let the batter rest for about 30 minutes to 1 hour for fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Leavening Agent:</strong> Just before steaming, mix in Eno fruit salt or baking soda. The batter will become frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Steamer:</strong> Fill a steamer with water and bring it to a boil. Grease a steaming tray or dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam the Batter:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared tray and place it in the steamer. Cover and steam for about 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Temper:</strong> In a small pan, heat oil and add mustard seeds and curry leaves. Allow them to crackle, then pour this tempering over the steamed dhokla.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Let it cool slightly, cut into pieces, and garnish with fresh coriander. Serve with green or sweet tamarind chutney. Enjoy!</li>
